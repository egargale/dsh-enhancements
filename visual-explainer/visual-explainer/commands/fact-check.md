description: Verify a generated document against actual code and git history
skill: visual-explainer
---
Load the visual-explainer skill and fact-check the document named by `$@`. If no argument is given, use the most recently modified HTML file in `./diagrams/` (`bash`: `ls -t ./diagrams/*.html | head -1`).

## Claim extraction

Read the target document. Extract verifiable claims about file paths, function/type/module names, behavior, architecture, data flow, APIs, commands, dependencies, tests, performance/security assertions, and git history. Skip subjective design opinions.

## Verification

For each claim, inspect the actual source or git history. Re-read referenced files. For diff reviews, compare before/after with `git show` or the relevant range. For plan docs, verify referenced files/functions/types exist and behave as described.

Classify claims as verified, corrected, unsupported, or unverifiable. Preserve the document's structure. Correct factual errors in place and add a verification summary that lists what was checked and changed. For HTML, match the existing page style and write the corrected file back with the `write` tool; report the path in chat. For markdown, report the path in chat.
